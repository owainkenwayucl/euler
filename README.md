Repository for my attempts at Project Euler solutions in Common LISP.

See https://projecteuler.net/archives for details.

Mostly this is me being very bad at Common LISP and then trying to be better.

Thanks to [Rainer Joswig](https://twitter.com/RainerJoswig) over on Twitter for his extremely helpful [constructive criticism re: 
solutions 1:3](https://twitter.com/RainerJoswig/status/948591585272520704) 

Originally my plan was to do one a day for January but at this point I'm finding that is taking a significant amount of my time out for other things so from now on (24th Jan) I will go slower.
