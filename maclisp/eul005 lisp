; Function to check to see if a number n is divisible by all the numbers up to
; l. In an effort to save time we count down from l and exit if we hit a number
; that doesn't work, returning nil.  If we reach 2 we know it's fine so return
; T.

; Recursion can be problematic but we will always be using small n for this
; problem.
