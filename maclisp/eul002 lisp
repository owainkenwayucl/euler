; Project Euler solution 2.
; Owain Kenway

; Sum up all the even Fibonacci numbers <= 4000000.

; To run this, (load "eul002 lisp") then (sol 4000000)

; Function to do our loop and sum.

; Significantly re-written as per discussion here:
; https://twier.com/RainerJoswig/status/948602262062092289

; Remember to set base and ibase appropriately on MacLisp on ITS as they 
; default to octal.
